`liquid` is a pure Go implementation of [Shopify Liquid templates](https://shopify.github.io/liquid), for use in [gojekyll](https://github.com/osteele/gojekyll).

It supports a functional API for defining tags and filters. On the one hand, this isn't idiomatic Go. On the other hand, this made it possibly to quickly implement a boatload of Liquid and Jekyll filters that would otherwise have been onerous. The jury is still outâ€¦

## Status

This library is in its early days. IMO it's not sufficiently mature to be worth snapping off a [versioned URL](http://labix.org/gopkg.in). In particular, the tag and filter extension API is likely to change.

## Install

`go get -u github.com/osteele/goliquid`

## Contribute

### Setup

```bash
make setup
```

### Workflow

```bash
go test ./...
```

Test just the scanner:

```bash
cd expressions
ragel -Z scanner.rl && go test
```

Preview the documentation:

```bash
godoc -http=:6060&
open http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/osteele/liquid/
```

### Working on the Parser and Lexer

To work on the lexer, install Ragel. On macOS: `brew install ragel`.

Do this after editing `scanner.rl` or `expressions.y`:

```bash
go generate ./...
```

Michael Hamrah's [Lexing with Ragel and Parsing with Yacc using Go](https://medium.com/@mhamrah/lexing-with-ragel-and-parsing-with-yacc-using-go-81e50475f88f) was essential to understanding `go yacc`.

The [original Liquid engine](https://shopify.github.io/liquid), of course, for the design and documentation of the Liquid template language. Many of the tag and filter test cases are taken directly from the Liquid documentation.

## Other Implementations

### Go

* [karlseguin/liquid](https://github.com/karlseguin/liquid) is a dormant implementation that inspired a lot of forks.
* [acstech/liquid](https://github.com/acstech/liquid) is a more active fork of Karl Seguin's implementation. I submitted a couple of pull requests there.
* [hownowstephen/go-liquid](https://github.com/hownowstephen/go-liquid) is a more recent entry.

After trying each of these, and looking at how to extend them, I concluded that I wasn't going to get very far without a parser generator. I also wanted an easy API for writing filters.
